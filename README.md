# DeepLearning_S102_FinalProject_206104_205181_Varas_Planaguma
Repository for the final project of Deep Learning 2020
LARGE-SCALE OBJECT CLASSIFICATIONS


The main objective is to build a neural network that is able to classify images of fruits into the corresponding type. 

We have used Fruit360 dataset but in a reduced way. The folder FinalProject contains all the needed data. 

The code can be found in code.ipynb.

We have tried 3 different models, obtaining accuracies between 87% and 97%.
Then we test some predictions.
Finally we wanted to try transfer learning in this project.
